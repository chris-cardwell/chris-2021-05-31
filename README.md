# Chris Cardwell Orderbook

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap this project.

## Deployed production build

https://chris-2021-05-31.vercel.app

## Run the project in development mode

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Create a production optimized build at `./build`

`npm run build`

## Serve the production optimized build

```
npm install serve
serve -s build
```

## Run tests

`npm test`.

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode (will automatically re-run all tests on save). Check out [these docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more info.
